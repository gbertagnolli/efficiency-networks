# efficiency-networks

This repository includes the code used in our work _Bertagnolli, G., Gallotti, R., & De Domenico, M. (2020). Quantifying efficient information exchange in real network flows. [preprint arXiv:2003.11374](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11374)._

In particular:

* R code for generating the synthetic networks
* R code for the evaluation of the global communication efficiency (GCE) of a weighted network, as defined in our paper.

If you use the code, or data, plaese cite our work _Bertagnolli, G., Gallotti, R., & De Domenico, M. (2020). Quantifying efficient information exchange in real network flows. [preprint arXiv:2003.11374](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11374)._
The `.bib` of the paper is also included in the repo.
